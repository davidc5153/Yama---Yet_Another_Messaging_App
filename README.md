<img width="64" src="./public/icons/yama-gold-196.png" align="left" />   **YaMa** is a messaging application aimed at small project teams that require a private, secure environment for users to communicate using text or voice messages. 

The goal of YaMa is to provide users with the power to control who has access to their communications by utilising intuitive grouping mechanisms.

YaMa has been created using common web technologies that will allow users to easily access their secure communications, with end-to-end encryption as default, on virtually any internet enabled device with a browser.
